  <description brief="Mirror Objects">
    This package takes as an input a segmented point cloud and the 
    current viewpoint of the camera and creates a complete point cloud in 
    which the occluded object backside is filled in. Additionally, a 
    watertight mesh of this completed point cloud can be created.
